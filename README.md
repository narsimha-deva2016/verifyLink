## Building for Production

```

This creates an optimized production build in the `build` folder.

## How It Works

1. **Welcome Page**: Greets your special someone
2. **Question Page**: Asks "Will you be my Valentine?"
   - "Yes" button leads to success
   - "No" button moves around and changes text when hovered/clicked
3. **Final Page**: Shows a beautiful page with hearts and love messages
